                    <div>
                        <p>Vacuum cleaners are a very common home appliance almost every household owns. They range in
                            size,
                            shape
                            and power, but their main purpose remains the same; to suck up dirt and dust from our house
                            floors,
                            allowing us to keep our houses clean. But why are they so widespread and common? If we
                            needed to
                            clean our floors, would'nt we just need to mop our floors? How did they end up
                            in every household and are they as important as they should be in keeping our homes clean?
                            This
                            study website aims to discover the phenomenon of vacuum cleaners.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Vacuum cleaners have become an essential part of modern home maintenance. They save time,
                            improve
                            indoor air quality, and make cleaning more efficient than traditional sweeping or dusting.

                            today’s fast-paced world, the convenience of vacuum cleaners has turned
                            them from luxury items into indispensable tools for maintaining a clean and comfortable
                            living

                        <div>
                            <p>Daniel Hess (1860) invented one of the first manual vacuum cleaning devices, using a
                                combination of rotating brushes and bellows-driven suction. Though not motorized, his
                                design
                                introduced key concepts—like suction—that shaped the future of vacuum cleaner
                                technology.
                                Ives
                                W.McGaffey (1869) created the "Whirlwind", a hand-powered vacuum cleaner that operated
                                with
                                a
                                wheel crank that powers an internal fan. This device was one of the first commercially
                                successful vacuum cleaners, marking a
                                significant step in the evolution of cleaning technology.

                            <p>The concept of mechanical cleaning dates back to the 19th century. Early carpet sweepers,

                                used rotating brushes, were precursors to the vacuum cleaner. The first powered vacuum

                                was invented in 1901 by Hubert Cecil Booth, a British engineer who designed a large,
                                horse-drawn, petrol-powered machine that used suction to remove dust. </p>

                            <p>Around the same time, in
                                the United States, inventor James Murray Spangler created a portable electric vacuum in
                                1907,
                                which he sold to William Hoover—laying the foundation for the Hoover Company, a brand

                        <p>Since their invention, vacuum cleaners have undergone tremendous evolution. Early machines
                            were
                            bulky and expensive, accessible only to the wealthy or for commercial use. Over the decades,

                            compact, affordable, and user-friendly designs. The mid-20th century saw widespread

                        <p>During the mid-20th century, advancements in vacuum cleaners skyrocketed. Introduction of
                            canister vacuums in place of bagged vacuums, flexible hoses for easier access, wet and dry
                            vacuums for differnt work environemnts, disposable paper bags replacing reusable vacuum bags
                            for

                            technology
                            advancing even further. James Dyson popularised bagless cyclone vacuum in the 1990s,

                            the bin to the filled while the vacuum runs. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters
                            became standard for trapping allergens and improving indoor air quality. Cordless models
                            also
                            improved thanks to better batteries. </p>

                            convenience
                            for vacuum cleaners. Robotic vacuum cleaners like Roombas became mainstream, while cordless
                            stick vacuums improved dramatically in suction power and battery life. Smart home
